## About Me

Hi! I am Romel and welcome to my page! 😃 Currently I specialize in 💻 sofware testing, but web development has always been a passion of mine. Right now, I am learning JavaScript, React, and Node.js.

Outside of coding or trying to advance my knowledge base with frameworks and libraries, here are a few things I enjoy doing in my spare time:

  - 🐟 Taking care of my aquarium
  - 🏠 Smart Home/Home Automation
  - 🌱 Growing tropical plants 
  - 🛌 Taking naps
  - 🏈 Playing sports
  - 🎥 Enjoying music, movies, or video games in my media room
  - 🍳 Cooking

You can also find me on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/omerome) as well as [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/romelwilliams/) posting about my web development journey and other topics I am passionate about.
