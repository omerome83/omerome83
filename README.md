## About Me

Hi! 😃 I am Romel and welcome to my page. I am in the 💻 IT field specializing in software testing. Web development has always been a passion of mine and I am currently learning JavaScript, React, and Node.js.

Outside of coding or trying to advance my knowledge base with frameworks and libraries, here are a few things I enjoy doing in my spare time:

  - 🐟 Taking care of my aquarium
  - 🏠 Smart Home/Home Automation
  - 🌱 Growing tropical plants 
  - 🛌 Taking naps
  - 🏈 Playing sports
  - 🎥 Enjoying music, movies, or video games in my media room
  - 🍳 Cooking
