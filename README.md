Hello there! I'm Romel. 👋 

My area of expertise is 💻 software testing, but my passion has always been web development. Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge by learning JavaScript, React, and Node.js.

When I'm not coding or exploring new frameworks and libraries, I love taking care of my aquarium 🐟, experimenting with Smart Home/Home Automation 🏠, nurturing tropical plants 🌱, taking relaxing naps 🛌, playing sports 🏈, cooking 🍳, and enjoying music, movies, or video games in my media room 🎥.
