Hello! My name is Romel Williams and I work full-time in the IT (💻) field specializing as a Software Tester.

- I’m currently learning HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, and Node.JS with the aspiration to becoming a web developer.
- I’m interested in growing tropical plants (🌱) in my cold-climate location, cooking (👨‍🍳), taking naps (🛌), taking care of my aquarium (🐟), and enjoying media (🎥) in my man cave.
